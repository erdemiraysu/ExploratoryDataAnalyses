### Data Wrangling - Tweeter (WeRateDogs)

Aim: To wrangle three data sets from the tweeter archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs, and then perform preliminary analysis to communicate the insights. 

The data sets used for the project (which are not included in the repository) are:

- Tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates. This dataset includes ratings of people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. -
- A Table of (dog breed) predictions gathered through a neural network using images.
- Additional retweet and favorite counts of the tweets gathered from Twitter's API.

This project uses a **jupyter notebook** and Python libraries **NumPy**, **pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **requests**, **tweepy** and **json**. 

Contents:

1. **wrangle_act.ipynb**: The main jupyter notebook involving the codes and project walkthrough. The notebook involves each step used to clean each of the issues documented while assessing the data as well as the steps used to analyze and visualize the wranged data. 
2. **wrangle_report (ipynb and html)**:  A brief written report that briefly describes the wrangling efforts - "Data quality and tidiness issues detected and corrected".
3. **act_report (ipynb and html)**: A brief written report that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from the wrangled data.
