### Analyze A/B Test:

A company has developed a new web page to see if their new design would help increase its number of users who "convert" - that is who decide to pay for the product. In this project I will be running an A/B test to help the company to undertsand if it should implement the new page, keep the old page, or  to run the experiment longer to make a decision. The experiment is run on two groups of people: treatment group has seen the new page, control group has seen the old page. For each user whether they were converted or not were recorded. 

Data sets which are not included in the repository:
- **AB_data.csv:** The data with user information. Two groups of people received either the treatment = new_page, or control = old_page. The conversion rate (paying for the product) for those who see the new_page was expected to be higher. 
- **countries.csv**: The data set has additional columns to describe from where the users were logging in: e.g. UK, US or CA

This project uses a **jupyter notebook** and Python libraries **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

Contents are:

1. The jupyter notebook involving the codes and project walkthrough in both ipynb and html formats: **PracticalStatistics_ABTest**
2. The jupyter notebook involving the code to show the 3 different ways to simulate new data in Python: **PracticalStatistics_ABTest_how_to_run_simulations_faster.ipynb**
